<p>This app implements a queue to adopt either a cat or a dog.</p>
<p>The user must first submit their name to the end of the queue, then a timer will start in which pets will start to get adopted at random and names will appear at the end of the queue.</p>
<p>Once the user's name is at the front of the queue, an adopt button will appear below one of the pets, to which the user can press to adopt</p>
<p>Their name will disappear and the animal they chose along with them</p>
